# Web Course
This is a collection of notes from some web development courses focused on **JavaScript**, **ES6** and **React**. For each section there will be links to the appropiate tutorials and other resources.

## JavaScript

The course introduces the most important .js concepts. JavaScript was originally designed in 10 days and it is now at the core of front-end client side web development.

### Variables
We declare variables with the let and const keywords
```js
// variables in JavaScript
let name = "Bob";
const pi = 3.14;
```
To display variables to the console we can use the `console.log` method.
```js
// log variables to the console
console.log("Hello World!");
console.log(name);
```
**String interpolation** is also useful for logging multiple variables together.

```js
// string interpolation
console.log(`My name is ${name}.`);
console.log(`The constant pi is equal to ${pi}`);
```
### Strings

Strings are declared using single or double quotes.
```js
// strings in JavaScript
let string = "JavaScript is Awsome!";
```
There are a number of useful methods for working with strings.
```js
// get the length of the string
string.length();
// get the string with capital letters
string.toUpperCase();
// get the string with lower case letters
string.toLowerCase();
// trim whitespaces from the string
string.trim();
```
